### Overview

This is an app where people can post and receive events that are happening in Nashville.  This would include checking today's events, sorting events into certain categories, and looking up events based on location. Users should also be able to declare they are going to events so that others can get a sense of how many people are attending and so events can be stored for the user to go back to later.

This app can be designed as a web or mobile app (this is left up to the implementing team's discretion). In addition, where the data comes from and the backend infrastructure is also left as a decision for the implement team. At the bottom, there are some suggestions for what to use as infrastructure.

###Suggestions

* Look at https://data.nashville.gov/ first to see if this has an API you would like to use for getting/sending events

* Look at https://parse.com if you want to build a quick backend to interact with your app.

* We are not requiring any user verification, but if you would like to incorparate this, both the Facebook SDK and parse.com offer easy verification.
